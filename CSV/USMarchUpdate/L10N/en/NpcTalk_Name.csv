101,Aymel,"Welcome! How’s your training going?<p>Training alone is boring and you probably don’t know where to start. In Aden, adventurers band together into groups called Clans.<p>Journey alongside other adventurers, donating to your Clan and purchasing from the Clan Shop! How about it?"
102,@101,"You reached Grade B! Surely you must know you are just getting started, right?<p>That meathead, Russel, has already reached Grade A!"
103,Russel,You’re looking a bit too laid back. Get to work and get to my level! Hahaha!
104,@101,"You’ve reached Grade A! Now you are on equal footing with that meathead! Don’t stop, keep at it!"
105,@101,You reached Grade S! Seems your rivalry with the meathead was the perfect stimulus!
106,@103,What?! You already reached Grade S? I’m still at Grade A...<p>Just you wait! I’ll catch up to you! You’ll see!
107,@101,"You’ve reached Grade R!<p>Don’t get cocky, now. There’s still Grade SR to reach!"
108,Theodore,You’re only at Grade R so keep up the hard work.
109,@101,"You reached Grade SR! You’ve left that meathead Russel in the dust!<p>Now you need to catch up to Theodore, who is Grade UR! Just a little more!"
110,@101,"Now you’re Grade UR!<p>Are you sure you’re not pushing yourself too hard? Well, Theodore has already finished and left. That meathead is still far behind so don’t feel rushed."
111,@101,You reached Grade UR! You were the second quickest after Theodore!<p>It’s quite impressive considering that meathead and others are on the verge of giving up!<p>Now you need to wait until the others are done. Why don’t you try starting over from the beginning?
112,@101,"Wow! Long time no see! You’ve become a lot stronger since the last time we’ve met.<p>But it’s still not enough. Theodore is already far stronger than you.<p>But don’t worry! I’ve created another training manual for you. It’s a bit tougher than the last one, though! So don’t fall behind!<p>Don’t sweat it too much! You’ll do great!"
113,@101,"Great, it looks like you’re progressing well! You reached Grade B pretty quickly!<p>Russel! Where are you at now, Russel?"
114,@103,I’m already Grade A! I won’t lose this time!
115,@101,@104
116,@101,You reached Grade S! Seems your rivalry with that meathead was the perfect stimulus!
117,@103,"What?! You already reached Grade S? I’m still at Grade A...<p>Ahh! Didn’t this happen last time, too…?"
118,@101,@107
119,@108,@108
120,@101,Congratulations on reaching Grade SR! Now that meathead Russel can’t even dream of catching up to you!<p>

101571,,Adventurers foolishly risk their lives just for money...
101611,,Fishing at Talking Island is the best - this fish is huge!

101931,,Talking Island Town is safe now.
101941,,Welcome to our town!
101961,,There are some odd things going on here...
101971,,"The quicker you can get off the island, the better."
101981,,"I heard there are more than 10,000 Orcs to the north."
102011,,Orcs have appeared in the north!!
102221,,Don’t worry! You’ll be discharged from duty safely.
102501,,Damn Orcs! I’ll avenge my comrades!
102511,,We can’t lose this battle. My family is hiding in the town.
102551,,These Orcs attacked just before my discharge...
102561,,"If we lose against these Orcs, they’ll reach the town."
103001,,"We’re holding the Orcs at bay with magic for now, but..."
103011,,*Inhale*... *Exhale*... I’m exhausted.
103021,,Orcs? They don’t scare me!
111671,,Please enlist Talking Island’s Blood Rangers!
111691,,Have you come to join the Blood Rangers?
111851,,I’ll be watching to see if anything funny happens!
111861,,There’s no need to go easy!
111891,,Cut them down with one swing!
111971,,Teach those Orcs a lesson!
111981,,T-thank you! It was so scary!
210011,,Soulshots are just what you need for fighting golems!
280811,,K-kill me...
280821,,Painful... End this...
300171,,I would’ve fought if I had my staff!
300181,,You were crying and hiding earlier!
304081,,Einhasad told me she would be sending you.
304111,,I saw your incredible performance! Thank you so much!
305851,,What’s all this?! It’s not even the age of pirates!
307781,,Ahh... I knew I shouldn’t have come here...
307791,,You! Calm down!
309371,,Tickets to Talking Island Harbor are this way.
309391,,Won’t you enlist as a Gludin soldier?
309411,,La-di-da... Where could have my friends gone...
309441,,"Next time, I’ll be the hero instead of you!"
309451,,"Welcome, this is Gludin Harbor town."
309791,,So you’re the one Einhasad sent.
309801,,Use this spot to travel where you want.
309811,,Register here to participate in Castle Siege.
309831,,Selling Soulshots is a hobby of mine.
309841,,Store items if your inventory is full.
309851,,Oops! I slipped again!
309861,,"Goodness, it’s noisy. I just want to live and fish quietly."
309871,,I’ll discount your bill since you’re our town’s hero!
309891,,We’re tasked with protecting this place.
309901,,*Sigh*... When will our shift be over...
309921,,@309891
309951,,It’s a member of the Silverlight Mercenaries!!! Welcome!
309961,,The recent ambush was thwarted a Silverlight Mercenary.
309971,,Oh really? That mercenary was so cool!
310331,,Hurray for Silverlight Mercenaries!
310341,,No way I’m going to an island. I’m made to live in cities.
310441,,Hello!
318221,,"Ah, the good old days when we traveled by boat!"
318231,,Thank you! My passengers are safe thanks to you!
318241,,"You defeated those pirates, right? That’s incredible!"
322561,,"Careful. Here on out, there will be Ol Mahums."
322611,,Are you enlisting to hunt Ol Mahum?
322701,,Safety of the hostage is our foremost priority. Got it?
322711,,"Are you crazy? Me, I wouldn’t go into the graveyard!"
322981,,You’ll need potions to hunt Ol Mahums!
392751,,"Hey, you! Do something about them!"
392781,,This is a lot of trouble after coming all the way here.
350151,,"Don’t be a cheapskate - give me more, you scrooge!"
350152,,You con artist cat!
350161,,Nothing beats Soulshots when hunting the Undead!
350162,,"Hey you, adventurer! You should buy some potions."
350163,,"Preparation is basic in battle! So, you should buy some..."
350181,,"Sheesh, all these Undead make business hard..."
350182,,Hey! Make a coffin for yourself while you’re here! Ha!
350191,,Don’t you feel scared?
350192,,"You should be careful, ghosts appear here. Haha."
350201,,Really! I really saw a ghost! Trust me!
350202,,There was definitely a blonde female Elf ghost!
350211,,"Quit lying so much, you liar!"
350212,,Say something credible! Sheesh.
350221,,Seriously? You really saw a Chaotic?
350222,,"You aren’t lying, right? You are also a likely suspect!"
350231,,I’m telling the truth! What about me says I’m a Chaotic?!
350232,,I’m sure even the person over there is stronger than you!
350241,,Be careful starting from Gludio - there will be Chaotics.
350242,,Have you come to investigate the missing incident?
350261,,"Check that guy out! Word is, he’s a Silverlight Mercenary."
350262,,If only I could have joined the Silverlight Mercenaries...
350281,,I’ve been requested to investigate the disappearance...
350282,,Are there no easy tasks?
350311,,"As expected of a harbor town, it’s brimming with energy!"
350312,,Is there nothing to see?
350321,,Hurry up! Let’s go over there too!
350322,,Wow! So spacious!
350331,,Phew. Can’t you go a bit slower?
350332,,"Slow down, won’t you? My legs hurt."
309911,,I’m giving this to you at a great price!
309912,,Not before I become a sphinx cat!
309931,,There are lots of outlaws. Be careful.
309932,,"You wouldn’t have any smuggled goods, would you?"
401151,,"Damn it... Just you watch, I’ll definitely survive."
401152,,I’ll survive and see my family.
410421,,Did any Lizardman happen to follow you?
410422,,It’s impressive to pass through the Devastated Farmland!
410331,,You the mercenary who hunts monsters? Take a breather!
410332,,My sword is ideal for cutting them lizards!
400131,,Won’t you join the hunting squad?
400132,,No use in sitting idly by! Hurry up and join us!
409511,,Only fools underestimate Bugbears for their low intellect!
409512,,Keeping the missing members safe is our top priority.
410391,,The monsters are close... I hope things will be ok.
410392,,"Oh, Einhasad... Keep Gludio safe..."
410521,,Ah... I wonder when I can go home...
410522,,How many more of these monsters do we have to kill?
410541,,This feels never-ending...
410542,,Mom... I want to see my mom...
410571,,It’s dangerous here. Go back if you’re not a combatant.
410572,,Report to the captain to join the hunting squad.
418501,,Don’t be noisy in town.
418502,,Joining the hunting squad if you need a job.
418561,,We can’t let Lizardmen continue coming over!
418562,,Damn lizards are constantly looking for opportunities.
400401,,Can’t believe these damn lizards ransacked our town...!
400402,,Why isn’t the ruler sending out reinforcements?
450471,,Hmm... Should I join to hunt monsters?
450472,,Won’t we have a difficult time at our level?
450481,,Let’s just go for it! I doubt we’ll die.
450482,,We’ll turn those Bugbears into shish kabab!
450491,,I heard Sir Vaughn would command the recovery operation.
450492,,Windawood’s revival is bound to happen soon...
450501,,We need to recover Windawood quickly.
450502,,Windawood’s tragedies need to end soon. Tsktsk
450531,,I hear the attack on Gludio Castle will start soon?!
450532,,"Ah, I’d love to participate in a Castle Siege!"
450541,,I’d cut my enemies down in one fell swoop!
450542,,Boo! There’s going to be a Castle Siege without me...!
450551,,"Recruiting participants for the Gludio Castle Siege, eh...?"
450552,,An Elf ruling a Human kingdom doesn’t sound too bad!
450561,,Don’t get any funny ideas of applying to the castle clan!
450562,,I’ll definitely become a beautiful Knight of the castle clan!
499711,,These Soulshots are best for hunting Lizardman!
506751,,Keep a ready formation as we make preparations!
506752,,Did you perhaps see any more scattered soldiers?
508741,,Have the Ol Mahums gone crazy?
508742,,Why are Bandits expressing interest in crystals?
512641,,Can’t believe the Undead are suddenly running rampant!
512642,,Everyone stay focused so we don’t scatter!
514601,,Windawood’s recovery is almost complete! Onwards!
514602,,It’s time we drive the Orcs from our home!
550011,,Beautiful Windawood has fallen into such disarray...
550012,,Damn you Orcs. I’ll have my vengeance!
550021,,The trees have all died...
550022,,I heard screams coming from the surrounding area...
550031,,Buy some potions before you go see them Orcs.
550032,,That’s not enough Soulshots to deal with Orcs.
607241,,Uh... Uh oh... Some items seem to be missing.
607251,,When will I move all this...
607261,,Why? Did something happen?
607521,,On duty! No problems at all!
607541,,@607521
607551,,C-could you take my post...
612811,,When will the merchant supplies arrive...?
612812,,"Hmm, our goods are running low."
630251,,You’re woefully under-prepared. Buy some potions!
630252,,These Soulshots do the trick when dealing with ants.
650061,,Ugh... those damn ants!
650062,,What could’ve caused such an ant to be created?
650071,,There’s a huge Queen in the underground Ant Nest.
650072,,Queen Ant? I wonder how beautiful she is!
650081,,I hear Ivory Tower Wizards died mysteriously?
650082,,Who could’ve killed the Ivory Tower Wizards?
650121,,"Dion Territory lies to the south. You're not a wanted man, are you?"
650122,,Be sure to identify yourself before heading to Dion.
650181,,They’re not allowing me passage into Dion Territory!
650182,,I’m sick and tired of this desert!
650191,,Aren’t you thirsty? Have some potion!
650192,,Take something from the Campsite with you!
650231,,Be careful. I hear Kazir appears right in front!
650232,,I’ve heard of Kazir! It’s the desert’s predator?
699711,,You’ll need potions to traverse the rough Wasteland!
706031,,"Hey, you! Your sword is rusty!"
706041,,We store your items safely!
706051,,I shouldn’t be selling items right now...
706061,,Did you see that kid from before?
706071,,Just say the word if you need my help!
706101,,Hahaha. I wonder if Gus is running the business well.
706111,,Looks like I’ll be scolded by Sara again!
706121,,"Oh, a kid. Don’t you need a drug to make you taller?"
706122,,You’ll grow big as a Bugbear if you eat this!
706131,,"Woah! But why are you so small, Mr. Cat?"
706132,,"Ehh, what a liar! There’s no drug like that!"
706141,,I can’t go outside because of the monsters.
706151,,Ah... I need to gather Herbs...
706171,,Will we drink today as well?
706181,,Great! See you when we’re done with our shift!
706191,,Welcome. This is Dion town.
706201,,Leave security up to us!
706211,,Did you see that girl just now?
706221,,"Of course! She seemed mysterious, no?"
706231,,They say spiders are eating Humans!
706241,,They say there are tons of spiders to the north!
799711,,Ah! It’s dangerous! Buy these Soulshots!
780471,,Ahha! Over there!
780481,,I won’t let you get away this time!
780491,,Get the key!
780911,,You can’t run from us!!!
780921,,After them! Go!
780951,,Die! Die!
780981,,This spell will swallow you all whole.
781001,,Grab them!
781021,,Capture them alive!
720091,,You will not leave this place alive!
750051,,Ah sheesh. I’m telling the truth!
750052,,I personally struck the Orc Captain on its head!
750061,,Orcs have made it all the way to Dion Castle?
750062,,We need to hurry and support Dion Castle - it’s in danger!
750081,,Pfft! You defeated the Orc Captain? You and what army?
750082,,Your lies are too incredulous! Hahaha!
750501,,"Careful, the Agricultural Area is full of Lizardman."
750502,,We made sure the Lizardmen and couldn’t go anywhere.
750521,,Cruma Tower has been emitting energy.
750522,,Cruma Tower... I definitely want to challenge it!
750531,,Tower of Lesser Giants? I wanna uncover its secrets!
750532,,I hear the Dark Brotherhood is after the Cruma Tower...
750551,,Hehe. Catch me if you can!
750552,,Wagon passing by! Honk honk.
750561,,The attack on Dion Castle gets my blood boiling!
750562,,I wonder who the ruler of Dion Territory will be!
750601,,"Ah, I’d love to be in a clan as cool as the castle clan!"
750602,,Hmm. Should I apply to join the castle clan?
750591,,We don’t have enough passion to make it... *sob*...
750592,,"I-if you do it, I’ll do it too!"
750621,,They’re looking for clans for the Dion Castle Siege!
750622,,No simple tasks anywhere? Like capturing a cat...?
750651,,Shhh! That cat hasn’t noticed us yet! Get him!
750652,,Let’s take one or two of these mangy cats!
750661,,Now! He’s distracted by the kid!
750662,,You want to join? You’ll be an accomplice too.
750681,,Look! That con artist cat will rip off more people.
750682,,You plan on ripping off that kid too? Sheesh!
800381,,Have you come to see Cruma Tower?
800382,,The tower of Lesser Giants - it’s getting me all riled up!
803881,,"Hmm... As expected of a swamp, it’s chilly."
803882,,Can’t you light a stronger fire?
804101,,"One, two.... huh? A few seem to be missing."
804102,,I can’t believe I’m investigating goods at this age!
804131,,Welcome to Feldheim Excavation Unit research camp!
804132,,Did you perhaps bring supplies?
850641,,Won’t my magic get stronger?
850642,,I hear there are tons of magical lifeforms in Cruma!
850661,,Ugh... Why do I always have to organize the documents?
850662,,You should’ve organized regularly. Look at this mess!
850671,,Be careful going forward - there’s a lot of corpses!
850672,,"If you find anyone we lost contact with, bring them here!"
899711,,What’s needed in this dangerous place? This potion!
998711,,Race isn’t a factor when doing business!
1019911,,"Buy more Soulshots for the Shrieking Hallows, okay?"
1050001,,"Hey, won’t you help in the operation?"
1050002,,This isn’t a good place for adventure.
1050021,,Ugh... My bones are aching.
1050022,,Are you making apt preparations against the Undead?
1050031,,May Einhasad’s Blessing be with you.
1050032,,I pray that you would give them rest.
1050061,,It’s dangerous to step outside of the Furnace.
1050062,,We’ve come to observe the Army of Agony.
1050051,,Watching them is making me sad.
1050052,,Be careful if you don’t want to end up like them.
1050201,,Are you an adventurer? Giran is currently sealed off.
1050202,,Giran is sealed until the Shrieking Hallows quiet down.
1050231,,You can’t go to Giran right now.
1050232,,The ruler ordered entry be prohibited.
1106931,,Hey there beautiful! Need some weapons?
1106932,,"With a dress so pretty, beware the Gorgon’s collections!"
1106933,,Come! Buy some equipment with those full pockets!
1191421,,Who are you? Have you seen anyone suspicious?
1191422,,Is it related to this incident?
1191431,,Did you see an Oren spy?
1191461,,I’m sure those damn Oren people sent a spy.
1150411,,Welcome to the Town of Giran!
1150412,,"Welcome to Giran, the center of commerce!"
1117001,,Don’t let your guard down with so many people around!
1117002,,Don’t follow strangers even if they offer you food.
1117003,,Can you remember the way back home?
1117021,,Come in for a moment and have a glass of tasty rum!
1117022,,Hey there you cool adventurer. Come in for a moment.
1117023,,Aren’t you tired from traveling? Come in and take a rest!
1170041,,What do you want? You want to go a round?
1170042,,"Turn around before you get hurt, okay?"
1170043,,What are you looking at? Bug off!
1170081,,You hear Giran and Oren’s relationship has gotten worse?
1170082,,"I’m anxious... You don’t think there will be a war, right?"
1170083,,I really want to visit Oren once...
1170091,,Adventure and whatnot... Kids these days tsk tsk...
1170092,,I’ll need to make connections when the envoys come.
1170111,,Come in for a bowl of warm soup!
1170112,,Are you from out of town? Come stay a night here!
1170113,,You look exhausted. Come and get some rest.
1170121,,Won’t you buy this one ring?
1170122,,You can’t find this anywhere!
1170123,,For the low price of 10 million Adena! It’s a steal!
1170151,,Count and make sure it’s the right amount.
1170152,,"Keep your guard up, the merchant will be here soon."
1170153,,We’re trading for rare magical materials - watch carefully.
1170161,,Mm... Should we have a taste to see if it’s cooking well?
1170162,,It’s lacking something... Would a bit of magical MSG do?
1170163,,"Hey, what are you looking at? Stealing our secrets!?"
1170181,,Vegetables! Buy some vegetables on the cheap!
1170182,,Got this from Dion and bypassed the Shrieking Hallows!
1170183,,Have a taste! A taste of the Plains!
1170221,,I’m telling you that Mischa glanced at me!
1170222,,I’m certain Gerard is interested in me!
1170223,,What should I do...? Should I start a conversation?
1170241,,What? First time seeing a cat?
1170242,,"You’ll be in for a beating if you underestimate me, punk!"
1170243,,Stick around if you wanna get beaten down.
1170311,,Should I join the Gorgon hunt? It’d be good experience...
1170312,,I don’t wanna become one of Medusa’s playthings...
1170313,,I’m too young and pretty to die... Hunt or not to hunt...!
1170291,,What’s so scary about that witch Medusa?
1170292,,Let’s join the hunt! What’s the worst that could happen?
1170293,,This isn’t a common opportunity!
1160101,,Thugs hang out in here. Be sure not to go inside.
1160102,,Any further in and it will be dangerous. Head back.
1160161,,Ready to head to the Gorgon Flower Garden?
1160162,,Hand in your will when you’re done filling it out.
1160163,,Never look Medusa in her eyes. Got it?
1170341,,Drink this - you’ll be immune to Medusa’s gaze!
1170342,,Afraid of heading to Oren? Buy this disguise tool!
1170343,,This fluoroscope helps catch spies and earn bounties!
1170371,,"Hey, are you a Silverlight Mercenary? I’m envious."
1170372,,All adventurers want to join the Silverlight Mercenaries.
1170373,,I’ll be a wizard like Lucien of the Silverlight Mercenaries.
1170381,,"Pretty, right? Don’t rip the grass out - it hurts them."
1170382,,"This is Einhasad Square. Let’s pray later, okay?"
1170383,,"Let’s be quiet since there are lots of people, okay?"
1170501,,Einhasad will look after you.
1170502,,Einhasad loves unconditionally and expects nothing.
1170503,,Love your neighbors like they are all Einhasad.
1170531,,Shh. Be quiet. The priest is speaking.
1170532,,"Oh Einhasad, I pray for my brother to return safely..."
1170533,,May you blessings those on the Gorgon hunt...
1170561,,Please... Make this world one without war...
1170562,,May you bless this land of Giran...
1170601,,Wow! I see grandpa’s boat!
1170602,,Woah! Birds!
1170603,,"Eeek! Come here, birdies! Come play with me!"
1200011,,Have you... come to save us?
1200031,,Meow... Should I have gone by land...
1200041,,Welcome to Shelter Town!
1200061,,"Word is, Giran Harbor’s in complete chaos!"
1200071,,All this commotion’s making it hard to do business...
1200081,,Lesser Giants’ Ruin! Doesn’t that excite you?!
1200091,,This is so hectic. Would you stop getting in the way?
1200111,,This is a crystal we brought over from Cruma!
1200281,,Not a single pirate should be allowed to leave!
1200301,,We’ll keep the refugees safe.
1200351,,Are there no relief supplies for merchants?
1211311,,We’re doomed with the harbor like this!
1399711,,These Soulshots will deal with those scary pirates!
1430361,,Can I pet this shaggy thing?
1430401,,What is this about?
1430421,,"Hello, stranger."
1430431,,"If you cut this tree down, it oughta fetch a good price."
1430491,,Why are there Undead here?
1430511,,It would’ve been nice if that shaggy thing came along.
1430541,,"Wow, I meet the shaggy thing again."
1430571,,Have you heard of a fairy living on Talking Island?
1430591,,@1430571
1430611,,Mm... from what it says on this stone tablet...
1430631,,Dwarf kid is small.
1430651,,It’s in an ancient Elf language this time too.
1430661,,We did it.
1430671,,Meow... blub blub... Meow...
1430681,,I’m full now.
1430691,,Protect me while I decode the stone tablet.
1430811,,"Well done, Cara."
1550061,,Coocoo! Coocoo!
1550071,,Coocoo! Keep searching!
1550091,,Oink! Oink! Sniff sniff.
1550131,,Coocoo has gone home safe and sound.
1550132,,I want to see Coocoo.
1550181,,"Something strange is growing on my back, meow..."
1550182,,Isn’t it already dead...?
1550191,,Argh... Damn Ravine Spiders!
1550192,,What is that person’s status?
1550241,,W-what is this ruckus about...
1550242,,The Bugbears are looking for me like I’m a tasty snack...
1550281,,We must protect the women and children!
1550282,,Make sure those pigs can’t come close!
1550481,,Argh... My wound hurts...
1550482,,This is my mistake. I was careless.
1550491,,"Russel, you idiot! I told you to be careful!"
1550492,,Are you hurt?
1571621,,You plan on escaping the cage?
1571622,,Execute them now!
1558351,,You plan to escape? You’ll regret your decision. Kekeke...
1558352,,"Wow, you’re quite bold! Well, you’ll be back here soon enough. Hahaha."
1558381,,"Hey, guard! When am I getting my food?"
1558382,,I was quite the force to be reckoned with when I was a free man!
1551881,,Did you... Did you really have to set fire to everything?!!!
1551882,,Caraku... We need to find Caraku!
1551961,,Kazan is done for!
1551962,,I’ll break that traitor’s neck myself!
1552081,,Argh! I’m so annoyed! Why don’t the Tanor talk at all?
1552082,,"Where is that fool, Russel?"
1552091,,I hope Durzel is alright. Hmm...
1552092,,Did you see Aymel? Is that tomboy alright?
1552191,,Where in the world is Durzel?
1552192,,I sense a foreboding energy...
1566401,,Genuine hunters don’t slack on preparations!
1566402,,There! They seem to need some Soulshots!
1565341,,I hear Oren Castle is in quite an uproar...
1565342,,They say adventurers in Oren Castle are accused of being Giran spies!
1565381,,They say the Forest of Secrets is somewhere in this Ravine!
1565382,,"And once you pass through the Forest of Secrets, you can supposedly get to the Ravine of the Fairies!"
1565531,,They say the Heart of the Plateau has been in the ravine the longest.
1565532,,Want to gather people and have a go at the Heart of the Plateau?
1565371,,We need to be careful since Giran and Oren aren’t on good terms!
1565372,,Be careful in Oren Castle if you’ve come from Giran!
1565441,,I wonder where that guy who went to catch a Grendel has gone...
1565442,,Could.... that guy have been captured by Poricule?
1569071,,"Shayden, you fool!"
1569072,,What nonsense are you spewing? Bugbears took an apron?
1569011,,Hmm. This Grendel meat stew is coming along quite well!
1569012,,We need to prepare quickly... the lord will be waiting...
1569101,,"As things stand, it will be difficult to complete our mission..."
1569102,,We can’t go back like this. Is there no one we can ask for help?
1569061,,Have you seen a giant Windsus?
1569062,,Be careful for Bandits around here!
1569041,,Oh my. We see you again!
1569042,,Mmm... the great outdoors! The ingredients around here must be superb!
1569311,,There are so many spiders!
1569312,,Should I ask the Nymphs to give me one flower petal?
1569221,,Have you perhaps seen a giant white flower?
1569222,,The Nymphs around here are quite aggressive. Don’t be seduced by their beauty.
1565601,,Don’t make a ruckus.
1565602,,Are you from Giran? Have you been inspected?
1565981,,Prepare well. We don’t know when people from Giran will come.
1565982,,What’s wrong with the ballista?
1565791,,Don’t look so tired already! Focus!
1565792,,We’ll start over from beginning and repeat until our actions synchronize.
1565661,,That uptight Guard Captain is back at it again...
1565662,,I only feel bad for the ones training under them.
1565561,,Head to get inspected when you enter the castle.
1565562,,"Any funny business and you’ll be sent straight to prison, so be careful."
1566081,,"Tell the truth! We were informed, so don’t you try to talk your way out of this!"
1566082,,Playing dumb won’t help you. You damn Giran spy!
1566181,,I heard some spies from Giran were arrested!
1566182,,"Oh my, what a scary world we live in... I wonder when our relationship with Giran will improve..."
1566021,,Don’t let your guard down.
1566022,,Those damn spies are everywhere!
1566351,,It’s dangerous to the west. Be careful!
1566352,,There is something different about the Lizardmen here...
1566061,,Do the Ivory Tower Wizards plan to shun us?
1566062,,Everything would be fixed if the Ivory Tower joined forces with us. Tsk tsk.
1566111,,We are all children of Einhasad.
1566112,,Einhasad will surely be angry if we kill ourselves in battle.
1566141,,Please... let there be no war...
1566142,,Let there be peace on this land...
1566091,,"Be sure to tell the guard about any suspicious people you might see, okay?"
1566092,,"Don’t go outside the castle, okay?"
1566361,,Go see Sereos for any clan-related tasks.
1566362,,Please report anyone you think might be a spy.
1566341,,Ah! The weather is so nice!
1566342,,You’ll be the tagger if you step outside the marking on the ground!
1565231,,Big Bait! Get your Big Bait!
1565232,,This fishing rod was blessed by Einhasad herself!
1566291,,What are you looking at? Bug off!
1566292,,Argh! Ptooey!
1566381,,Sigh... Why is the world so scary?
1566382,,I hear the girl next door was also accused of being a spy...
1565971,,Be careful of Lizardmen and Orcs.
1565972,,Ask for help from the castle if the situation turns dangerous.
1569231,,I wonder how we can take the egg without anyone noticing...?
1569232,,Do you perhaps want to start a business dealing Lizardmen eggs?
1569251,,Woah! What a surprise! What are you doing here?
1569252,,That Renner. I’ll show him my real skills!
1569253,,My cloak... It was brand new...
1569321,,Have you come to hunt the Orcs as well?
1569322,,We meet again!
1569323,,Are you ready to go hunt some Orcs?
1569261,,"Oh, what brings you here?"
1569262,,Have you come to help me out again?
1569271,,Sell me the Mace of Punishment if you happen to find it!
1569272,,Did you see the Tanor leader’s corset? It seems like it will fetch a good price.
1569301,,Long time no see!
1569302,,How about we all try becoming a Tanor Chief?
1610011,,Lacking recovery potions? They’re on sale for cheap!
7920011,,Care to hear the request the clan received?
7920012,,You’ll be able to use more space when the Clan Hall level increases!
7920021,,Have you heard of Varkaron’s ancient relic?
7920022,,Bring by any interesting relics you find!
7920023,,Just the thought of relics is getting me excited! Haha!
7920041,,Don’t use such low-quality potions - leave it to me!
7920042,,My potions are definitely Aden’s best!
7920043,,A single potion makes you feel strong as a Bugbear!
7920031,,Woah! The scenery is amazing!
7920032,,How could a Flower Bouquet be so red?
7920033,,The maid girls are so pretty!
7920061,,"If your stomach rumbles, come and find me!"
7920062,,I cook food daily with fresh ingredients!
7920063,,Wanna be the taste tester for my new dish?
7920081,,Don’t forget to come see me once a day!
7920082,,"I’ll have daily gifts for you, meow!"
7920083,,I’ll have better gifts when your Clan Hall level increases!
7920181,,Isn’t it just so pretty? It’s red as a lady’s lips!
7920182,,Leave the flower garden’s care to me.
7920183,,You need any flowers? Who are they for? Hehe!
7920191,,Did you complete all of this week’s Clan Hall Quests?
7920192,,You find me that pretty? Please try not to stare.
7920193,,I really like the warmth of the Clan Hall Fireplace.
7920194,,Our clan is the best clan in Aden!
7920111,,Welcome to our Clan Hall!!
7920112,,Welcome! It’s a perfect day to enjoy the garden.
7920113,,I’ve been waiting for your arrival! Welcome!
7920131,,Yikes... Where could I have put it?
7920132,,The Keeper will surely be waiting...
7920133,,Hmm... I left it here. Where could it have gone?
