gained immense power unlike any other,
and became the new <RedBold>Timak Orc Leader</>,

and follow him.

stuck in his heart.

now had amazing, but terrifying strength.
He called himself the warrior, <RedBold>Ramog</>,
and killed any orcs that got in his way.

<RedBold>Timak Orcs</>.

In his constant search for power, he began to
 look for the power of <RedBold>Paagrio</>, the god of orcs.
Eventually, he attacked <GreenBold>The Timak Orc</>
<GreenBold>Shaman Village</> where <GreenBold>Paagrio’s Altar</>
