<p>I didn’t intervene, as it wasn’t serious yet, but while you were gathering crystals, the Ol Mahum bastards stole our stored crystals.

<p>The Ol Mahum are trying to steal the crystals from here, the crystals used to make Soulshots, right? If we can take some crystals, we could earn a little money on the side...
<p>Hey! That was a joke! Don’t look at me like that!"
It’s Not for You!,Find the missing mercenary,Reinheim,"Did you retrieve the crystals? Good. There was another Silverlight Mercenary who came before you. His name was Russel, I think.

Surrounded Mercenaries?,Duel with the Ol Mahum,Russel,"This is just a guess, but the Ol Mahum here are strange.
<p>They act as if they’ve lost their minds. Perhaps someone’s controlling them.
<p>They have no reason to expand their territory from the western coast to here, where the Orcs are in charge.
<p>If we fight the Ol Mahum Vanguard over there, we may find something. What do you say?",Russel,"Oh, their activities are very suspicious.

<p>The missing comrade and Edina ran away... Looks like surviving for three days was a miracle.
<p>This area is where Beleth was sealed several centuries ago. Where we’re standing should have a statue of Gran Kain...
<p>I don’t know why, but there’s nothing remotely resembling the statue. We must investigate the ruins nearby. Please, search with me.",Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"Had I known this would happen, I would have brought some teleportation stones myself.

How to Hide Yourself I,Collect Wastelands Basilisk blood,Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"Anyway, you seem to have a very interesting item. A bag full of dark energy...
<p>Planning to keep it? I would recommend throwing it away... but it’s also useful as evidence of what happened here.
<p>Hmm... Let me examine it. It... has a curse for a specific target. It should be properly dealt with. Luckily, this is my specialty.
<p>It will require some ingredients, but this curse can be controlled. Could you bring me basilisk blood?",,
How to Hide Yourself II,Collect Mutant Armored Ant essence,Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"Basilisk blood also contains dark energy. You just apply it like this. Hmm... Smells like rotting fish.
<p>Now, I need one more thing: essence of the mutant ants. I hope you don’t expect me to explain why.",Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"You can use the mutant ant’s essence like this. Ugh, It’s so sticky. What an unpleasant feeling."
Finding the Merchants,Go to the campsite with Emon,Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"Now that I’ve completed this temporary treatment, holding the bag will not activate the curse.
<p>We should head to the campsite where a merchant named Staris is staying. He knows the area very well, and could deliver our message to the Ivory Tower in no time.

,,Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"<p>Huh? Staris? Apart from the poisoned mouth, he looks like the Staris I know of! What the...
<p>If you pity the old man, will you bring some mutant ant saliva?

<p>If not, can you deliver the message personally?",,

<p>The Silverlight Mercenaries use teleportation stones every day, but the Ivory Tower can't?",,
,,Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"Ugh... You know the price of a teleportation stone. And distance is the main factor when communicating with magic! I told you before!
<p>From here to the Ivory Tower... only the grand mystic could do that!",,
,,Staris,"Okay! Okay, you old elf. This is my specialty, I’ll handle it!
<p>But... I have something to request as well. Your other friend from the Ivory Tower is missing. I can’t go to the Ivory Tower without knowing their condition...

Desert Thieves,Find a clue from Sahara Ghosts,Western Adventurer,"So you’re the Caravan Master Staris’s friend! That bag belonged to one of the seekers in this region. A standard issue item for the caravan.
<p>I was worried about him since we lost contact, and to think, he ended up like this?
<p>He was hunting saharas. Seemed like he was looking for something... Why don’t you follow his trace?",Western Adventurer,"I’ve never seen that tablet before. You found that from a Sahara Wraith?
<p>Odd, that adventurer was good at hunting. To think he would fall to such evils."
If a Clue Can be Found...,Find a clue from Giant Leeches,Western Adventurer,He also caught a Giant Leech to study. I think I heard him going on and on about dark energy...,Western Adventurer,"Come to think of it, I remember him gathering things similar to these tablets. So, is that why he hunted those Sahara Spirits and Giant Leeches?"
In Search of the Graveyard,Go to the wizard’s grave,Western Adventurer,"Oh! That adventurer lingered around a mystic’s grave over there.<p>Looked like they were meeting someone... I was about to report it to Staris, as it was very suspicious.<p>There’s really nothing but tombstones there. Head west to find the mystic’s grave.",Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,Welcome. If you’re here I must be in the right place.
Don’t Eat It!,Recover the tablet devoured by the leech,Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"They seemed to be investigating this area. And what’s that tablet you’re holding?
<p>That’s what my comrade was hunting for? Can I see it?
<p>This tablet emits dark energy. Seems the evils consumed this.
<p>We should see if other evils have these too. Let’s start with the Giant Leeches!",Ivory Tower Wizard Emon,"The reason evils consume the tablets is because the tablets contain dark energy.
<p>But it’s rare for these tablets to contain any dark energy at all.
<p>Unless it’s connected to something powerful like Beleth reviving..."

Vendor Monta,Collect parts held by Eroded Saharas,Vendor Monta,"Hey, a little help here? I was on my way to the campsite, but some black-robed woman summoned evils and wrecked my wagon.
<p>The wheels especially. Could you get back the wheel parts that those evils took?",Vendor Monta,"Just look at that wheel! Why did they take parts they can’t use?!
<p>I’m Monta from the Staris caravan. Where are you headed? You don’t look like you’re from here."
Helping the Caravan,Defeat Mutant Armored Ant Fighters,Vendor Monta,"Huh? On your way to Staris? So you’re the Caravan Master’s guest?

Another Caravan,Talk to Vendor Monta,Vendor Monta,"Thanks to you, we should be able to get to the Campsite. Oh, you should be careful around that woman in the dark robes. She sure makes things tough on us!

Another Caravan,Learn about Summoning Circle,Vendor Monta,"Oh, hold on! You match the description of the person Feldheim was looking for a few days back. Do you know Feldheim?<p>I knew it! He was looking for you in a rush! I believe he was heading to the Summoning Circle in Mount Eborga.<p>How about you pay him a visit? In the Summoning Circle, you will probably be able to get some Summoning Stones that can be used to strengthen your mount.",,

<p>May we meet again under better circumstances. Goodbye! Now... to craft bombs to use against my mortal enemies...",Theodore,"<YellowBold>[player]</>! To think I’d see you here! The Staris caravan’s southern barracks is right beyond this rock. Or rather, the barracks were there. Did you look around?<p>The barracks were destroyed, and only skeletons are wandering here.<p>I heard that Staris was attacked by these evils as well, but it’s hard to believe that anyone who knows the Wasteland so well could be waylaid so easily.<p>Someone must be targeting the Staris caravan on purpose. Did you see anyone suspicious?"
The Broken Tablet,Collect the incomplete tablet fragments,Theodore,"The evils of the Wasteland are strange these days. They are more aggressive and vicious than before.
<p>Maybe they’re on the alert, maybe they are under someone’s control.
<p>We should investigate the area.",Theodore,"This looks like the stolen Holy Artifact from the Gludin Harbor. Hmm... Did the evils become rampant because of this?
<p>This world is balanced between the power of light and power of darkness.
<p>The Holy Artifact’s destruction must have released a large amount of holy energy, and the dark energy must have seeped in to create a balance between them.
<p>If the evils were under the influence of that dark energy, then that might explain the things going on in the Wasteland.
<p>Who the hell would do this? Is this the doing of the Dark Brotherhood? There are so many questions remaining."
The Dead Wizard,Investigate the corpse found by Theodore,Theodore,We need to look around. Help me.,Theodore,The corpse of a cardinal... Perhaps something far worse than the Staris caravan’s problem is happening here... Or perhaps something has already happened...
Staris’s Request,Meet Staris,Theodore,"God forbid, but we should prepare for the worst.
<p>The resurrection of Beleth seems to be reality.
<p>I must report this to the master. <YellowBold>[player]</>, keep helping Staris.",Staris,"Where have you been? Did you find the missing men?
<p>...I-I see. Murdered by people in black robes?
<p>I have someone in mind. Black robes make it obvious!"
Staris’s Crisis,Escort Staris into the canyon,Staris,"Must be Tiana! If she’s targeting our caravan, she must be trying to interrupt our business negotiations. If it were me, I’d do the same.
<p>If this negotiation succeeds, a trade route directly to the Ivory Tower will be opened. We need to head into the canyon... watch your head.",Staris,"Escaped?! How could this happen?! <YellowBold>[player]</>! You didn’t let her go on purpose, did you?

Raiding Among the Brethren,Defeat Looter Guard,Staris,"See there? Ol Mahum fighting between themselves! Looks like the Ol Mahum have been divided into two factions.

<p>We’re on the Chief’s side, of course! All of my work could be ruined!",Staris,"Good job. If this goes well, I will take the upper hand in the negotiation with the Ol Mahum Chief."
Punish the Looter,Take the minerals from Looter Guards,Staris,"Unlike most Ol Mahum, the Ol Mahum here are sustained by mining rather than pillaging. Their largest customer is us, the Staris caravan.<p>So the Ol Mahum here value minerals more than their lives.<p>We should help and retake the stolen minerals from the looters here.",,
Suspicious Ol Mahum,Go to Red-Hair Ol Mahum Town,Staris,I must meet the Ol Mahum Chief. Follow me!,Staris,"W-wait! We must assess the situation.
<p>W-what is this?! Absolute chaos! This is a full-scale war.

<p>I infiltrated to assist you, but never thought it would be this bad!"
The Strong and the Weak,Defeat Ol Mahum Pillage Warriors,Staris,"Damn! Looks like one of my men followed us inside the Ol Mahum Stronghold.

Story of the Ol Mahum Town,Meet the Red-Hair Ol Mahum Leader,Staris,"Whew... It’s you. Is he safe?
<p>This is the tent of the Red-Hair Ol Mahum Chief. I finished talking with the Chief.
<p>Since the Ol Mahum have been fighting each other, it’s difficult to tell who’s on which side. See there, they don’t have red fur. Hard to tell the difference... Huh?
<p>Hey, they’re drawing weapons! Those Ol Mahum are acting strange! Look over there!",,
Story of the Ol Mahum Town,Protect the chief from the Looters,,,,
Recovering Corpses from the Civil War,Recover the Red-Hair Ol Mahum Corpses,Staris,"You know the situation- the ones against trading with us revolted.
<p>What makes it strange is that the rebels act as if under someone else’s orders.
<p>Whatever the cause, the Staris Caravan agreed to cooperate in suppressing the rebellion. First, they are asking us to clear this area by recovering the Ol Mahum corpses.",,
Dispute Over Minerals,Go to the barracks holding the minerals,Staris,"Seems that looters are occupying the mine right now.
<p>Seems the Chief of the Ol Mahum here had to retake the mines to show his power.

<p>Now, let’s go to the entrance.",Staris,Hmm... The Looters are all around here.
Slay the Looters,Defeat Ol Mahum Pillage Warriors,Staris,"To retake the mine, we should first deal with the looters all over the area.",Staris,"Now that the Looter Warriors are gone, the Ol Mahum can take it from here. We have other work we must do!"

It’s an order of sorts.",Russel,"Welcome, <YellowBold>[player]</>. You’re here just in time. I arrived a moment ago, too. I’m afraid I don’t know the details of this situation.

<p>It will be wise to clear them out before dealing with the captain.",Russel,Nothing is more important than food in the Wasteland. Looter morale will certainly drop now.
Destroy the Ol Mahum Weapons,Destroy the boxes containing weapons,Russel,"Next, the weapon boxes! Destroying their weapons should effectively weaken their strength!
<p>You know, this Staris guy... he doesn’t seem like a simple merchant. Anyway, let’s do this quickly!",Russel,"Whew, that was difficult. Mission accomplished!"
Covetous Ranger,Defeat Ol Mahum Looter Rangers,Russel,"What was next? Ah, dealing with the rangers!<p>Seems Ol Mahum Looter Rangers are also guarding the leader.<p>It would be wise to clear them out.",Russel,"Now that no one’s blocking the way, there’s only one target left."

<p>We’ll need lots of them. Let’s spread out.",,
Investigating the Omen,Investigate the memorial park,Valter,"Hardin told us to check for any remaining corpses at the cemetery. If the corpses at the cemetery are moving, that means Guillotine’s resurrection is imminent.

The Dark Incinerator,Examine the other incinerator,Valter,"There are several incinerators nearby... We should check them all.
<p>In the past, there were many deaths due to tyranny and many were cremated.
<p>Corpses were deserted near the incinerator after Guillotine was resurrected as a demon. 
<p>There will be strong undead wandering near the incinerator because of that. It’s dangerous, but it would be best to spread out since we don’t have a lot of time. Take care.",Valter,"I’ve already dealt with this Soulstone, but the ones over there..."

<p>Please defeat the Doom Servants nearby before destroying the Soulstone.",,
Collecting Souls,Defeat Koma the Collective of Souls,Valter,"Wait... you see that? That’s Koma, a collective of souls.
<p>The Restless Spirits are gathering... They are feeding off each others’ darkness, reveling in death...
<p>Leave it and it will be a huge threat later on. Let’s defeat them.",,

The Final Job,Use a reagent on the Soulstone I,Hardin,"Who would install the Soulstones here other than the Dark Brotherhood? Collecting dark energy like that... We can’t allow it.
<p>If you try to destroy a Soulstone that is already full of souls, you can get hurt. We need something safer.
<p>Use the reagent Peddler Pan gave you on the Soulstone. It will release the souls inside.",,
The Final Job,Use a reagent on the Soulstone II,,,,

The Loudest Client,,Peddler Pan,"Now I will guide my fur-iends to a safe place! Thanks for your help, meow! See you later!",,
The Loudest Client,,Theodore,"Peddler Pan asked me to find you.
<p>Ugh... You have no idea how much he whined. I had to come here just to stop listening to it.
<p>Pan will take care of Alice and Vehin.
<p>We have somewhere else to go. Follow me.",,
Dicor Raid,Defeat the incoming Dicors,Theodore,What’s this? Dicor are pouring in! Get ready!,Theodore,"They are not strong, but with their numbers, they are a threat. I don’t remember them being so aggressive... The Dicor around here are strange."
A Different Hometown,Defeat Dicors of the Forest,Theodore,"Dicor are swarming here... This never happened before. It’s quite disturbing.
<p>Can you eliminate those Dicor?",Theodore,"If you didn’t, I would have. Thank you."
An Abandoned Cloak,Check the cloak on the floor,Theodore,Those Dicor looks suspicious. Is that a cloak on the ground? We have to check it out.,Theodore,It’s not the work of the Dark Brotherhood... But not an ordinary Dark Mystic either. This discarded cloak is reeking of dark energy...
More Dark Energy,Defeat Dicors of Hallucination,Theodore,"Now I am curious about the identity of the cloak’s owner. I don’t have any urgent business anyway. 
<p>Look! Dicor have gathered because of the dark energy from this cloak.",Theodore,Things near a powerful mystic emit magical energy over time. The owner of this cloak must be a powerful mystic.
Suspicious Tree,Check the Suspicious Tree,Theodore,"I always had a strange feeling in this forest, even when this was my home... I should find out why.",Theodore,A guardian like this?! It would require tremendous effort! What is sealed inside here? This is highly suspicious. I should investigate the other trees too.
Suspicious Tree,Return to Theodore,,,,
Suspicious Tree,Talk to Theodore,Theodore,"This tree is part of a seal for something. I don’t have a clue as to who could have made it... but the method used here... Whoever it is is far from average...
<p>I will decipher the seal... Hmm? What is this?",,
Suspicious Tree,Talk to Theodore,Theodore,"Ah, I made a mistake! Get ready! The Seal Sentry will come out!",,
Suspicious Tree,Defeat the Seal Sentry,,,,
The Mutated Forest,Collect Dicor of the Forest leaves,Theodore,Hm... Looks like monsters here have been altered by something. Will you bring some Dicor of the Forest leaves? I’ve got to investigate them.,Theodore,As I thought... Someone has altered the monsters here to be more aggressive than usual. But why? I must investigate further.
An Empty Tree,Investigate the Suspicious Tree,Theodore,That tree should be investigated too. The tree seems to have rotted and turned hollow inside. There must be something there.,Theodore,What is this? It’s not something you would find inside a tree...
Elf’s Log,Collect elven log I,Theodore,"These are elven records... They’re a bit difficult to read due to the condition.
<p>There may be other documents. Could you find them for me?",Theodore,...A demon called blood queen is mentioned. And a story of a wizard...
Elf’s Log,Collect elven log II,,,,
Elf’s Log,Collect elven log III,,,,
Do Not Disturb,Defeat succubi,Theodore,"This is almost a puzzle. It will take time for me to decipher it. The succubi over there are making it difficult for me to concentrate...
<p>Clear the area for me!",Theodore,So that mystic and an arch-demon taught the elves dark magic...
Traces of Dark Magic,Collect Succubus wings,Theodore,"The one who taught dark magic to the Dark Elves... it’s probably Dasparion.
<p>Could you bring me some succubus wings?",Theodore,I sense dark magic from the succubus wings. I wondered why succubi would be in an Elven ruin. Perhaps a Dark Mystic summoned them here.
Desecrated Homeland,Find Succubus Queen,Theodore,Damn! A Succubus Queen here... Can you defeat it? I don’t want that queen to desecrate my hometown!,Theodore,"Thank you. If the queen stayed here, this would have become a succubi nest... Someone must have summoned them on purpose... Who could that be?"
Desecrated Homeland,Defeat Succubus Queen,,,,
Evidence of Dark Magic,Collect Forest Werewolf claws,Theodore,Those werewolves seem to be enhanced by the power of dark magic. Can you gather their claws? I need to check them out more closely.,Theodore,"The werewolf claws also have traces of dark magic enhancement. It’s the same as the succubus wings.
<p>If Dasparion did this, he really was a powerful mystic..."
Poisoned Werewolf,Stop the werewolf horde,Theodore,"Why are the werewolves and succubi so strong here? Something’s not right, something feels off.
<p>Watch out! Werewolves incoming!",Theodore,I’m guessing they controlled the werewolves to fend off the intruders. What are they guarding?
Trace of a Seal,Investigate the Suspicious Tree,Theodore,"The designer of this seal is using the life force of the trees nearby. If I’m right, trees closer to the seal should be weaker.
<p>Look for other trees. Some of them should be unnaturally drained.",Theodore,"Following the traces of the weakening trees led us here.
<p>This is a pattern used for sealing. The seal is very weak now by the looks of it..."
Demons of the Magic Circle,Defeat the incoming werewolves,Theodore,"A demon! A demon has been sealed here!
<p>Watch out! The seal is weak! The demon’s on the loose.",Theodore,It was fortunate that she couldn’t fully escape. The seal is still working.
Demons of the Magic Circle,Talk to Theodore,Theodore,"So the Blood Queen has been sealed here. We should strike now, before she fully recovers!",,
Demons of the Magic Circle,Defeat the summoned succubi,,,,
Demons of the Magic Circle,Talk to the Blood Queen,,,,
Demons of the Magic Circle,Defeat the Blood Queen,,,,
Blood Queen’s Order,Take the evil order,Theodore,What’s that? Did the Blood Queen’s mimic drop it? We should investigate. Can you bring it to me?,Theodore,(......)<p>(Theodore looks unconscious.)
Blood Queen’s Order,Give the order to Theodore,,,,
Blood Queen’s Order,Give the order to Theodore,Theodore,"An order written by Dasparion? Interesting...
<p>You should rest up while I examine this order. Find me back at the stairs when you’re ready.",,
Blood Queen’s Order,Hardin’s secret,,,,
Blood Queen’s Order,Return to Theodore,,,,
Why Theodore?,Talk to Hardin when ready,Hardin,"Did it surprise you? My apprentice read the forbidden demon’s spell. Any later and I might have had to kill him myself.
<p>I must send Theodore back to the mercenary base camp. Could you wait a moment?",Hardin,"I sent him via teleportation spell, so don’t worry. He will be alright after the treatment."
Thirsty,Take the water from Eva’s Fountain,Hardin,"Whew... that took a lot of effort... it’s good that I came here personally. A wizard’s passion can lead to their demise. Theodore has no evil intent, so don’t think ill of him.
<p>Wreaking havoc in the elven hometown will make the goddess Eva angry. We should pay a tribute.
<p>Purifying Eva’s fountain of the dark magic should suffice. I will cast a simple spell on you. Just reach the fountain and touch the water inside.",Hardin,Looks good. The water from Eva’s fountain is emitting light as it was before.
The Unworthy Monster,Defeat the Forest Werewolves,Hardin,"I don’t follow the goddess Eva, but I don’t want the fountain to be contaminated again. Please eliminate the werewolves near the fountain.",Hardin,May the Goddess Eva look over you.
A Horrendous Box,Check the other box,Hardin,I feel the presence of entities summoned by dark magic inside that box. Better destroy it.,Hardin,"Ha ha, looks like the monsters inside the box are frightened by you."
A Horrendous Box,Defeat the summoned evils,,,,
Slay the Succubus,Defeat the Seductive Succubi,Hardin,The succubi are insidious. They will strike from behind when we’re not ready. Better to defeat them when we can.,Hardin,Now I feel more at ease. We don’t need to worry about attacks from behind. The succubi are still here because of the Blood Queen.
Cleaning Up,Collect the Purple Herbs,Hardin,"Those succubi make me think that more cleaning up is required to amend the situation caused by my apprentice.
<p>I need to strengthen the seal of the Blood Queen since it seems to be summoning monsters around it.
<p>The herbs over there were once grown by elves, but they’re wild now. They can increase the duration of spells. Go gather them.",Hardin,Well done. Give me the herbs. I will put them to good use.
Recovering the Records,Collect Swift Snipe hearts,Hardin,"I feel bad about taking lives, but I need the hearts of those Swift Snipes over there.
<p>They will be catalysts for the seal. Not all seals require this, but my method does.",Hardin,"Give it to me right now. If we’re too late, it won’t be of any use."
Sealed Again,Go with Hardin,Hardin,Now we have all of the ingredients. A strong demon warrants more attention. Let’s move.,Hardin,I must prepare the surrounding area before we continue.
Using the Tree,Defeat Elder Dicors,Hardin,"Now I will strengthen the seal using these ingredients and the spirit of the trees. Since it’s Dicor turf here, they will attack when I initiate the spell.
<p>Deal with the Elder Dicors before I begin.",Hardin,Well done. The preparations are complete.
Help Out,Enhance the power of the seal,Hardin,"You should lend your strength. Share your power with the tree which will endure the demon’s seal.
<p>Just touching it will suffice.",Hardin,Good work. I hope the Blood Queen likes the new seal.
Help Out,Enhance the power of the seal,Hardin,Ugh! It still has power in it?!,,
Help Out,Defeat Blood Queen’s minions,,,,
Lizardmen are the Culprits,Talk to Hardin when ready,Hardin,"Now we shall resume our mission. It was supposed to be Theodore’s assignment, but you should take it instead.
<p>There was a request from the Lord of Giran. The gift and envoy sent from the lord of Innadril have not arrived.
<p>We must act quickly. Diplomacy between Giran and Innadril is at stake. Aymel and Russel are also coming. I will help you until they arrive.",Hardin,We failed to gather any new clues from this.
Lizardmen are the Culprits,Abduction of the Innadril Ambassador,,,,
Lizardmen are the Culprits,Talk to Hardin when ready,Hardin,"We already have a suspect, so all we have to do is hurry. The only ones foolish enough to touch the Innadril envoy would be the lizardmen.
<p>There’s a Lizardman Sentry over there. Look for any clues.",,
Lizardmen are the Culprits,Defeat Langk Lizardman Sentrys,,,,
The Search Begins,Defeat Langk Lizardman Scouts,Hardin,"This is a shortcut between the Giran Castle town and the harbor, but few come here because of the lizardmen. If someone’s been ambushed, there will be traces left.
<p>We must find traces of the Innadril envoy. The best we can hope for is that the Innadril ambassador is still alive.
<p>Before we search around, we have no choice but to defeat the Lizardman Scouts.",Hardin,Masterfully done.
"Shh, Quiet!",Defeat Langk Lizardman Warriors,Hardin,"When Aymel and Russel join you, make sure they understand that the safety of the Innadril ambassador is paramount. Alright?
<p>And until you find the Innadril ambassador, defeat any lizardmen you encounter.
<p>If the lizardmen learn that we’re looking for the Innadril ambassador, they could use him as a hostage. We have to pass that road, so defeat those Lizardmen Warriors in the way.",Hardin,It’s going well so far.
Switch with Aymel,Join Aymel,Hardin,"That must be Aymel over there. Is Russel not here yet? You will be fine with Aymel by your side. Finish the mission.
<p>I’ve got to return to the base camp and check up on Theodore.",Aymel,"Uh, Hardin, sir? Hmm, leaving without answering. Is he busy?"
Lizardmen Hunting,Defeat Langk Lizardman Fighters,Aymel,"Been a while, <YellowBold>[player]</>. You’re here for the Innadril ambassador too? I wasn’t briefed that we’re on the same mission! Just don’t get in my way.
<p>You think that lizardmen are the culprit, right? I’ll take them head on!
<p>Cracking them upside the head should give us a clue. Let’s start with those Langk Lizardman Fighters!",Aymel,Good! You learned something!
Weakening the Shaman,Destroy Langk Lizardman Totems,Aymel,"There, do you see that totem in front of the barracks near the shaman? Destroy it and it will make those shamans crazy!",Aymel,Good! The shamans will be upset!
Find the Tribute of Lords,Check the pillaged items,Aymel,"I think they piled up the loot over here. There could be things from the envoy!
<p>...
<p>Ah! Boring! Where’s Russel when I need him? Check if there are any tributes from the envoy among these.
<p>Hey, there’s Russel! Good, you two can do his while I look around.",Russel,"Hey, you were here too? Have you seen Theodore or Aymel?"
The Lizardman that Noticed,Defeat Langk Lizardman Fighters,Russel,"Theodore’s not coming? Alright. So, it must be Aymel who destroyed the totems. I told her not to make hasty decisions, but it just goes in one ear and out the other. Aymel... Sigh.
<p>Shamans brought fighters with them because of the wrecked totems. They’re still a problem, even without the totems!",Russel,"Perhaps you’ve heard, but finding the tribute is part of the mission. Is Aymel going to fight with the lizardmen and do nothing else?"
Step Out of the Entrance,Defeat Langk Lizardman Recruits,Russel,"Well, searching around this bounty is a mess. If it’s not here, then we should find the chief’s home. It’s hard to see in this darkness...
<p>There must be someone guarding the chief’s lair, right? Let’s trust our instincts! Defeat those recruits!",Russel,Have a good time with the recruits? Look over there. Shamans are training the fighters with witchcraft.
Stop the Ritual!,Defeat Langk Lizardman Shamans,Russel,"Fighters will be weakened if we stop the ritual, so take out the shamans first!",,
Will It Be Here?,Take the Tribute of Lords,Russel,"Look here! It must be a tribute to the lord of Giran!
<p>This must be the chief’s home, let’s leave before they find us!",Russel,Tough guy! But where the hell is Aymel?
Will It Be Here?,Defeat Langk Lizardman Warchief,,,,
Shaman’s Watch,Defeat Langk Lizardman Shamans,Russel,Now we must leave. The shamans are already here because of the fight with their chief. Let’s deal with them first!,Russel,"Ugh, filthy beasts! They just keep coming!"
Pouring Recruits,Escape the Langk Lizardman Training Grounds,Russel,Let’s get out of here before more of them arrive!,Aymel,"Russel! Ah, so loud! I was looking for the missing people!"
Preventing Witchcraft,Defeat Langk Lizardman Elder Shamans,Aymel,"I found the way out. We’re leaving, right? We have to go through there...
<p>I think the shamans are enhancing the fighters! Let’s defeat the shamans first!",Aymel,Did I see correctly? Over there!
Poor Merchants,Rescue the imprisoned merchants,Aymel,The envoy’s merchants are imprisoned! I was wondering why there were no corpses! Let’s free them!,Aymel,There should be a VIP here... Where would he be... He’s not here...
Safety Secured!,Defeat Langk Lizardman Troopers,Aymel,We must reduce the number of lizardmen to ensure the safety of the hostages. What are you doing? Go get them!,Aymel,"Whew, now the hostages should be able to escape!"
Evacuate the Prisoners,Lure Lizardmen with Aymel,Aymel,"Where’s the Innadril ambassador? He’s not here.
<p>Create a diversion to let these merchants move safely.
<p>I will distract the lizardmen with <YellowBold>[player]</>. Russel should protect the merchants.",Aymel,"Hey, wait! Wait! Look at that!"

<p>If Theodore wasn’t here, it really would have been my end.
The area is full of danger, only you are capable enough to gather the herbs. Will you do it?",Feldheim,"What a rascal! But he must have learned a lesson, thanks to you. Ha ha ha! How funny!"
A Sly Ambusher,Talk to Feldheim,Feldheim,"Thanks! But there are too many who are wounded. Maybe that’s a good thing, it’s better than being dead...
<p>But we’re really short on medicine, there could be more casualties soon. You can’t gather herbs forever...
<p>Why don’t you remove the threats so that we can gather the herbs ourselves? There are monsters that appear whenever we gather herbs.

Elven Ruins,Go to the ruins with Pan,Peddler Pan,"This is the Elven Ruin’s remains. It can be used for spells, but only great wizards like Hardin can use it. It will take a century to extract mana from the remains.

Leave This Land!,Slay the Soul Devourer Prima,Cara,"With your skills, perhaps we can drive out the primas from this land.
<p>The leader should be the one with the most souls. Let’s defeat it.
<p>With their leader dead, they won’t be able to approach our borders so easily. I will light an elven lamp near the lair.

How to Restore the Land,Collect Twilight Sahara’s heart,Peddler Pan,"Good work finding my money pouch. Elf is also working hard, so I will tell you something useful. Those Saharas eat nutrients from the ground.
<p>People think they appear in dead lands, but it’s the opposite. The land becomes dead because of the sahara.
<p>And you know the stone that looks like a heart when you kill saharas? Plant it in the ground and you can return the nutrients to the land. If you want to restore the land, plant the hearts in the ground!
<p>Now I will be on my way! I still have to look for the items Hardin ordered! I will gather what I can gather alone for now!",Cara,How did it know that I wanted to restore this land?
To the Hunter’s Retreat,Bury Sahara's heart I,Cara,"Now let’s bury this heart into the ground and go to the hunter shelter.

<p>Damn. They left a few days ago.
<p>There are basilisks in the south, maybe they went there. Be careful, if you look around you just might find them...",Hammon,"If it’s not in the south, then it’s the Chasm of Oblivion... It’s a place far more dangerous."

A Difficult Path,Follow Feldheim,Feldheim,"Well, it’s not a simple excavation this time. The Silverlight Mercenaries requested this.
<p>Or, should I say Hardin requested this? It’s dangerous, so let’s go to my post first.

<p>That’s it. We need more fragments to understand what it means."
A Suspicious Tablet,,Cara,"The ancient elf? Ha ha, do you think all elves can read ancient elf text? What simple logic!
