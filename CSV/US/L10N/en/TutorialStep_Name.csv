11006,,
12001,Feldheim,<YellowBold>Soulshots</> allow for stronger attacks.
12002,@12001,You should start by using Soulshots automatically!
12003,@12001,Soulshots are only used <YellowBold>when you attack</>.
12004,@12001,They stay safe and sound with you at all other times.
12005,@12001,Don’t want to use them automatically? Just tap again.
12006,@12001,"<YellowBold>Soulshots are available in the Shop</>, so stay well stocked!"
12007,,
13001,Niah,Let’s learn about Daily Dungeons.
13002,@13001,You can find the entrance in the Dungeons menu.

13004,@13001,"If you keep up with your training, you’ll be able to tackle them soon!"
13005,@13001,"For now, let’s check out the Daily Dungeon."
13006,@13001,"In <YellowBold>Daily Dungeons</>, <YellowBold>different monsters appear every day</>."
13007,@13001,Defeat them to acquire <YellowBold>special rewards</>!

13009,@13001,Go on - head inside!
13010,,
13011,,
13012,,
13013,@13001,Auto-Battle is available if you need help.
13014,,
13015,,
13016,,
13017,@13001,Wow! That was one powerful monster you knocked out!
13018,,
13019,@13001,"You can only enter a few times per day, but don’t worry! The count <YellowBold>resets daily</>."
13020,,
13021,,
13022,@13001,"<YellowBold>It won’t count as an entry</> if you fail, so don’t be afraid to challenge yourself!"
13023,@13001,That was a solid effort. Better luck next time!
13024,,
14001,Archon Daniel,Time to check your achievements and claim rewards.
14002,@14001,The first step is to enter Challenges.
14003,@14001,That will lead you to Achievements.
14004,@14001,Have your <YellowBold>achievements</> acknowledged and receive <YellowBold>rewards</> for them.
14005,@14001,It seems you’ve been working hard. You’ve already completed some <YellowBold>achievements</>.
14006,@14001,Go ahead and claim this reward.
14007,,
14008,@14001,Well done. You will acquire <YellowBold>titles and abilities</> based on your meritorious deeds.
14009,@14001,So stop by often to stay updated.
14010,@14001,"Keep working hard, and your efforts will be quickly rewarded."
14011,@14001,"The higher your achievement level, the stronger your abilities - and you’ll receive supply items as daily rewards."
14012,@14001,"Be mindful of <YellowBold>the different kinds of achievements</> to complete, and don’t ignore any of them."
14013,,
15001,Merchant Anais,The Shop is full of helpful supplies.
15002,@15001,Like this one right here. Remember what it looks like - it’ll come in handy later on!
15003,@15001,What are you waiting for? Open it up!
15004,,
15005,@15001,Wow! That’s a fantastic piece of equipment!
15006,@15001,Do you know how to make equipment stronger? You <YellowBold>level it up</>!
15007,@15001,"You’ll get <YellowBold>one free High-grade Equipment Box daily</>, so don’t forget to stop by!"
15008,,
16001,Ferron the Blacksmith,You came to the right man if you want to <YellowBold>level up</> equipment. I’m the best blacksmith on Talking Island!
16002,@16001,"Here, take this equipment. It should be useful for you."
16003,@16001,Let’s take a look at the equipment you received.
16004,@16001,It should be in the armor tab.
16005,@16001,Go on and select the equipment I gave you.
16006,@16001,You can level up equipment at the Forge. Follow me.
16007,@16001,There are <YellowBold>various ways to strengthen equipment</> using the Forge.
16008,@16001,Select Level Up.
16009,@16001,<YellowBold>Level up</> uses other equipment as material to <YellowBold>improve</> the equipment you primarily use.
16010,@16001,"Now, there is a small fee for the service... I’d be out on the streets if I did this for free, heh!"
16011,@16001,Use this as material. Let’s call it a gift!
16012,@16001,"Well, we’re all set! I can do this for free just this once. Our secret!"
16013,@16001,The materials will disappear during the process.
16014,,
16015,@16001,"All finished! Let’s take a look. Hey, it’s a success!"
16016,@16001,Go ahead and equip it now that it’s leveled up!
16017,@16001,It’s as easy as tapping Auto Equip!
16018,,
16019,@16001,Leveling up your equipment <YellowBold>is the easiest way to improve your combat abilities</>. Try leveling up your equipment if enemies are too powerful.
16020,,
17001,Captain Austin,Well then! Let's move onto leveling up your skills.
17002,@17001,"Before we start, we’ll need to see what skills you use."
17003,@17001,Let’s take a look at your skills.
17004,@17001,"Here, you can raise your <YellowBold>skill levels</> and <YellowBold>switch the locations of skill buttons</>."
17005,@17001,You’ll need Skill Points to raise the level of your skills.
17006,@17001,You can acquire SP by raising your character’s level and by playing consistently.
17007,@17001,Okay. Let’s <YellowBold>level up your skills</>.
17008,@17001,Hmm. This skill will do.
17009,@17001,"Do you see the level up button? It’s tempting, right?"
17010,@17001,You can use <YellowBold>SP</> to <YellowBold>raise skill levels</>.
17011,@17001,"Normally, this would cost some Adena... However, I’ll help you out this time since you were so helpful recently."
17012,@17001,Oh! And one more thing!
17013,@17001,See the passive skills here?
17014,@17001,<YellowBold>Passive skills</> can be leveled up the same way. Let’s try it out.
17015,@17001,"First, select a skill."
17016,@17001,"Then, you can spend SP and Adena to raise its level."
17017,@17001,"<YellowBold>Passive skill</> effects are automatically activated, so they can be easy to overlook - but it’s important to remember them if you want to become stronger."
17018,,
18001,Russel,The Arena is the best place to test your skills.
18002,@18001,You can find it on the Battlefield!
18003,@18001,See the Arena entrance? Prepare yourself!
18004,@18001,You can fight <YellowBold>1 on 1 duels</> against other adventurers. It’s a great place to prove your skills!
18005,@18001,Select one of the 4 opponents from the list and defeat them! You can rise to greater heights by fighting and defeating stronger opponents!
18006,@18001,<YellowBold>Weekly rewards</> are given out based on your weekly ranking. Work hard to consistently place high!
18007,@18001,Don’t forget that duels go hand-in-hand with Honor!
18008,@18001,Honor is given to winners and losers alike.
18009,@18001,Accumulate Honor to reach higher ranks and acquire <YellowBold>stat rewards</>!
18010,@18001,Hmm... you don’t have any Honor to speak of right now...
18011,@18001,But that’s easy to fix!
18012,@18001,"With dedication, you’ll earn more Honor and better rewards!"
18013,@18001,Well? Do you feel pumped?
18014,@18001,Don’t be modest - let’s get dueling right away!
18015,@18001,"Select Start. There’s no telling who your opponent will be, but I’m sure you’ll beat them to a pulp!"
18016,,
18017,,
18018,@18001,I knew you’d win! Congrats!
18019,,
18020,,
18021,,
18022,@18001,"Ouch... That was close! Well, there’s always next time!"
18023,,
19001,Academy Professor Eugene,Allow me to teach you another way to improve equipment.
19002,@19001,"Combine is relatively simple, but it gets the job done."
19003,@19001,You’ll need to use the Forge to combine equipment.
19004,@19001,You can combine equipment here.
19005,@19001,Combine two level 30 equipment pieces of the same grade and type to acquire one piece of equipment of a grade one greater than the material used.
19006,@19001,Equipment is categorized into target equipment and material equipment.
19007,@19001,Check the details of the target equipment here.
19008,@19001,Let’s not waste any more time - it’s time to combine. Use this as combining material.
19009,,
19010,@19001,Tap this.
19011,@19001,Take this and use it as material equipment.
19012,,
19013,@19001,Select this material equipment.
19014,@19001,"If the material is ready, let’s combine."
19015,@19001,There’s no time. Hurry up with it.
19016,,
19017,@19001,Success! Seems the preparations are ready.
19018,@19001,"Don’t forget to equip your equipment! Oh! Combine <YellowBold>produces the same type as the main material equipment</> so keep that in mind! Well then, good luck!"
19019,,
20001,Lieutenant Arthur,Want to know about clans? Tap the main menu.
20002,@20001,Tap the Clan button here.
20003,@20001,You would do well to join a clan that matches your beliefs.
20004,@20001,You’ll find that there are many benefits to membership.
20005,@20001,Oops! Here I am suggesting you join a clan without even explaining what clans are!
20006,@20001,"The key aspects of clans are <YellowBold>Castle Siege</> and <YellowBold>Fortress Siege</>, where you can battle other clans over various castles and fortresses."
20007,@20001,"And of course, clans can’t be competitive without significant power."
20008,@20001,All citizens of Aden can <YellowBold>bet on the winners of a Castle Siege and win prizes</> during the <YellowBold>Castle Seige Festival.</>
20009,@20001,"And that’s not all! When you’re in a clan, you can reap benefits from <YellowBold>buffs, the clan shop, clan quests, and rewards</>."
20010,@20001,Let’s look at <YellowBold>how to join clans</>.
20011,@20001,This is how you join clans.
20012,@20001,Anyone can choose a clan leader they believe in and work together to reach the top!
20013,@20001,"If you like the look of one of these clan leaders, tap <YellowBold>Apply</>!"
20014,@20001,I’m excited to see what clan you’ll join!
20015,@20001,Or maybe you’ll strike out on your own and become the leader of a new powerful clan!
20016,,
21001,Theodore,Have you heard about the <YellowBold>Tower of Insolence</>? Every Adventurer in Aden should enter it at least once.
21002,@21001,"Well, then. Let’s try the Tower of Insolence now."
21003,@21001,You can enter the Tower of Insolence through the Dungeons menu.
21004,@21001,Do you see the infinitely tall tower? That is the Tower of Insolence.
21005,,
21006,@21001,<YellowBold>The Tower of Insolence</> was constructed by Emperor Baium of Elmoreden in defiance of the gods.
21007,@21001,"Although it was once called the Tower of Eternity, enraged with wrath, the god Einhasad filled it with monsters."
21008,@21001,"The higher you climb in the tower, the stronger the monsters you’ll encounter - and the better the treasures you’ll find."
21009,@21001,"Curious? At present, you should be able to at least clear the first floor."
21010,,
21011,,
21012,,
21013,@21001,Not too shabby.
21014,,
21015,@21001,"For each floor you’ve already cleared, you can acquire additional rewards once per day using <YellowBold>Auto-Clear</>."
21016,@21001,"Here, you can check the Auto-Clear reward for each floor."
21017,@21001,You can acquire <YellowBold>Rune Fragments</> using Auto-Clear. Think of it as a key to improve your combat abilities.
21018,@21001,I'll teach you more the next time I see you.
21019,,
21020,,
21021,@21001,Hmm... Seems you haven’t trained enough...
21022,@21001,Let’s return by tapping the screen.
21023,,
22001,@21001,"I’ll teach you Rune Imprinting, which will allow you to use Rune Fragments to get stronger."
22002,@21001,Rune imprinting is a means of directly improving your character.
22003,@21001,Use this to try out rune imprinting for yourself.
22004,@21001,"Through rune imprinting, the abilities of each rune become yours <YellowBold>permanently</>."
22005,@21001,"Rune imprinting requires <YellowBold>Rune Fragments</>. Yes indeed, those things you acquired through auto-clearing the Tower of Insolence."
22006,@21001,We’ll perform the most basic kind of rune imprint.
22007,@21001,You can check here to see the materials required for rune imprinting.
22008,@21001,"Now, give rune imprinting a try."
22009,,
22010,@21001,"Since this is your first time, I’ll provide you with the materials necessary."
22011,@21001,The preparations are ready. Try imprinting.
22012,,
22013,@21001,Did you notice the large rune in the middle? That is the <YellowBold>Core Rune</>.
22014,@21001,The <YellowBold>Core Rune</> level increases when all the runes on each page are imprinted to the same tier.
22015,@21001,"Remember, Core Runes grant <YellowBold>many more stats</> than ordinary runes do."
22016,@21001,"As you’ve noticed, this is the Core Rune."
22017,@21001,Core Runes grant many stats that you can look forward to.
22018,@21001,And finally... these aren’t all the runes that can be imprinted.
22019,@21001,You can use this to unlock more rune pages.
22020,@21001,You can imprint <YellowBold>more diverse and powerful runes as you gain access to more pages</>.
22021,@21001,"However, <YellowBold>all runes on a page need to be imprinted a level greater than Lv. 1</> in order to unlock the next page."
22022,@21001,"Rune imprinting draws out powerful abilities, so it requires adequate preparations."
22023,@21001,Well then! I look forward to seeing how strong you’ll become through the power of rune imprinting.
22024,,
23001,,
23002,@21001,Let’s open the Inventory.
23003,@21001,Select the Armor tab.
23004,@21001,Equip the headgear I gave you.
23005,@21001,"You do know to tap equip, right?"
23006,@21001,If you carefully inspect the headgear you just equipped...
23007,,
23008,@21001,You can find the slot to equip Soul Crystals.
23009,@21001,Soul Crystals are gemstones containing the souls of monsters. Equipping them results in <YellowBold>the soul’s stats being applied to equipment</>.
23010,@21001,The traits of Soul Crystals determine their stats. Stronger souls provide <YellowBold>more powerful stats</>.
23011,@21001,You can use Soul Crystals as material to create <YellowBold>more powerful ones</>.
23012,@21001,We’ll be equipping Soul Crystals to this equipment.
23013,@21001,Here’s a Soul Crystal acquired from defeating that monster.
23014,@21001,Nice. Let’s equip it.
23015,@21001,"Well done. Next, we’ll look into <YellowBold>upgrading</> Soul Crystals."
23016,@21001,<YellowBold>Upgrading</> is the only way to <YellowBold>increase the grades</> of Soul Crystals.
23017,@21001,Go ahead and tap Upgrade.
23018,@21001,Tap the Soul Crystal you want to upgrade.
23019,@21001,"Tap level up, and you’re all set."
23020,@21001,"Then, tap Upgrade to see the magic happen."
23021,@21001,
23022,@21001,Well done. Let’s get out of here.
23023,@21001,"If you have better headgear, equip that instead."
23024,@21001,Simply tap auto equip.
23025,@21001,Remember that you can only <YellowBold>upgrade</> Soul Crystals when you have the necessary amount of Soul Crystals of the <YellowBold>same grade and type</>.
23026,@21001,That’s it about Soul Crystals. One Soul Crystal could be all the difference between victory and defeat. Use them wisely.
23027,@21001,One Soul Crystal could be all the difference between victory and loss. Use them wisely.
24001,@12001,You can enter Elite Dungeons from the Dungeons menu.
24002,@12001,I trust you know how to get there.
24003,@12001,There! See the Elite Dungeon? Select it.
24004,,
24005,@12001,"I stumbled across this place during my time as an archaeologist...
The most vile monsters in Aden appear here."
24006,@12001,"You may even encounter monsters you can’t handle on your own - you should take some <YellowBold>trusted friends</> along. The higher the risk, the greater the rewards."
24007,@12001,The lord will post new Elite Dungeon missions each day.
24008,@12001,You will receive additional rewards each time you complete 5 missions.
24009,@12001,You can acquire additional Exp. during this time each day.
24010,@12001,It’s dangerous to venture into Elite Dungeons alone. Parties provide safety in numbers.
24011,,
25001,@21001,I’ll teach you how to upgrade equipment.
25002,@21001,"You remember how to get to the Forge, right?"
25003,@21001,Here we are.
25004,@21001,Go ahead and tap upgrade.
25005,@21001,Use Upgrade Stones <YellowBold>to raise equipment grades while maintaining their appearance and stats.</>
25006,@21001,"In order to upgrade equipment, you need <YellowBold>Upgrade Stones specific to the equipment parts</>."
25007,@21001,"For example, you need <YellowBold>Accessory Upgrade Stones</> to upgrade accessories."
25008,@21001,Check here to see the expected upgrade result.
25009,@21001,"Well, let’s upgrade some accessories!"
25010,,
25011,@21001,Tap this ring to place it in the upgrade slot.
25012,@21001,Tap this button to start the upgrade.
25013,,
25014,@21001,It’s a success! Congratulations.
25015,@21001,Use the upgrade feature if you want to <YellowBold>keep a preferred piece of equipment’s stats or match set equipment</>.
25016,@21001,Keep in mind that Upgrade Stones are rare and difficult to obtain.
25017,,
26001,Purifying Fairy,Enhance equipment using scrolls.
26002,@26001,Tap an item.
26003,@26001,You need to go to the Forge to enhance equipment.
26004,@26001,Tap the enhance button.
26005,@26001,<YellowBold>Equipment-specific enhance scrolls</> are required to enhance specific equipment types.
26006,@26001,"Remember, <YellowBold>Blessed Scrolls</> can enhance up to +3 at once."
26007,@26001,You can gain additional bonus stats for matching the enhancement levels of multiple pieces of equipment. It pays to keep things even.
26008,@26001,"Don’t forget, equipment has maximum enhancement levels depending on its grade."
26009,@26001,Let’s enhance this weapon.
26010,,
26011,@26001,Enhance scrolls are kept on the Other tab.
26012,@26001,Select a Scroll: Enhance Weapon.
26013,@26001,Steady... enhancing has a chance of failure.
26014,@26001,"If you’re all set, start enhancing."
26015,,
26016,@26001,Success! I hope you like it.
26017,@26001,"Be careful. Successful enhancements can raise a piece of equipment’s stats, but failure can lead to the enhancement level dropping."
26018,,
27001,@12001,I’ll teach you how to use the Codex. Follow me.
27002,@12001,You can find the Codex in the Challenge menu.
27003,@12001,Here we are.
27004,@12001,You can register Cores obtained from monsters in the <YellowBold>Codex</>. Collect Cores to level up the Codex and <YellowBold>increase your stats</>!
27005,@12001,"If you collect <YellowBold>all of the Monster Cores in a specific region</>, your <YellowBold>stat bonus increases even more</>."
27006,@12001,I’ll teach you <YellowBold>how to register Cores</>.
27007,@12001,Red Rouse is a monster that appears in West Talking Island. Select it.
27008,@12001,There are enough Cores to complete the Codex. Good. Craft the Codex!
27009,,
27010,@12001,"Well done. Easy, right?"
27011,@12001,"All monsters can drop Cores, but regular monsters won’t drop them very often."
27012,@12001,<p>Focus your hunt on <YellowBold>Named Monsters</>. They’re guaranteed to drop Cores.
27013,,
28001,@26001,I’ll teach you one rare skill I know.
28002,@26001,It should be of some help. This way...
28003,@26001,"Here, you can learn rare skills."
28004,@26001,Select the Forgotten Scroll.
28005,@26001,"<YellowBold>Rare skills</> are different from normal skills and <YellowBold>are both efficient and powerful</>. Anyone can use them, regardless of their class."
28006,@26001,"But, it’s important to note that rare skills cannot be learned normally or leveled up. You must gather <YellowBold>Forgotten Scroll pages</> to complete your Forgotten Scroll."
28007,@26001,Select the skill page I handed you just now.
28008,@26001,We need to create a Forgotten Scroll.
28009,,
28010,@26001,Nicely done!
28011,@26001,You can use your <YellowBold>Forgotten Scroll</> to learn a rare skill. Check your inventory.
28012,@26001,Go on...
28013,@26001,This way.
28014,@26001,Hurry...
28015,@26001,Open your inventory.
28016,@26001,Here’s the manual.
28017,@26001,This is the Forgotten Scroll that was made just now.
28018,@26001,Tap use to learn the skill.
28019,@26001,Well done! Now try registering a rare skill to a slot.
28020,@26001,Okay. Let’s go back to the Manage Skills screen.
28021,@26001,Here.
28022,@26001,I trust you know what to do.
28023,@26001,"Yes, just like that."
